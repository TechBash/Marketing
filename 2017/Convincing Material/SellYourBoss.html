    {Recipient Name},<br /><br />

    I wanted to send a quick request for your approval to attend the TechBash Developer Conference on October 4-6, 2017 in Mount Pocono, 
    Pennsylvania. This event will help us tremendously by demonstrating the latest trends in technology today as well as the hottest 
    technologies including, but not limited to, popular JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, and Aurelia, DevOps Technologies 
    such as Docker, Kubernetes and VSTS, .NET Core, Cloud implementations with Azure and AWS, and artificial intelligence. The event will 
    improve our knowledge in these areas leading to greater productivity and efficiency.<br /><br />

    The event promises three days of in-depth and intensive technical training on some of the technologies we use every day. We will also 
    learn about other technologies that could further assist our efforts over the next twelve months. As of now, the conference tickets are 
    just $349. If I stay overnight, the entire event would cost less than $1000. Similar events are typically priced at around $2000 just 
    for the conference ticket.<br /><br />

    <strong>As an attendee, I'll get to:</strong><br /><br />

    <ul>
        <li>Attend three days of training on technologies that we use.</li>
        <li>Learn the latest trends in application architecture.</li>
        <li>Hear how teams have implemented DevOps and pick up tips for improving our process.</li>
        <li>Discuss how to leverage Cloud technologies securely.</li>
        <li>Discover how to update to .NET Core.</li>
        <li>See how artificial intelligence and machine learning are shaping business decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    I strongly believe that the information I can learn at this conference will allow me to help save our company time and money in the long 
    run. It will provide me a platform to learn new and improved ways to help lead our team, straight from the experts. Iâ€™ll also have that 
    opportunity learning these items in just three days as opposed to other conferences that may require travel and keep me out of the office 
    for a few extra days. Therefore, I would like to request your approval to attend this conference. I would be more than happy to answer any 
    questions you may have or discuss this further. Thank you so much for you time and consideration.<br /><br />

    PS - If we send at least 5 people to the event, we can save $50 off per ticket. We can email one of the organizers at 
    <a href="mailto:groups@techbash.com" target="_blank">groups@techbash.com</a> for more details.<br/><br/>

    Thanks!
