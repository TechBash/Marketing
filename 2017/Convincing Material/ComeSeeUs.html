    Here are some other reasons to attendâ€¦<br/>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Content</strong> - TechBash got great content. Want to learn about the latest frameworks and patterns from industry experts? TechBash has got them. Want to hear directly from Microsoft employees and MVPs? There will be plenty of them. TechBash is bringing in the best speakers from top tech companies to deliver content to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> - TechBash is organized by a small group of developers who were tired of traveling across the country for good content. So now they are bringing the content to you. TechBash is in the Poconos in Pennsylvania. That's less than a 2 hour drive from NYC or Philly. Plus, the short drive time means you won't need to ask your boss for two extra travel days.</li>
        <li><strong>Price</strong> - Book now and you can register for TechBash plus 3 nights in the hotel for less than $1000. That's a great price for a conference of this caliber. Plus, no airfare needed so TechBash fits into your budget!  After 9/8 hotel rates may vary.</li>
        <li><strong>Venue</strong> -  The Kalahari Resort. This is the largest indoor water park in the country. So while you are coming to learn and network with tech leaders from around the country and meet up with old friends and new, you can have a little fun and hit the water slides.</li>
        <li><strong>Fun for the Family</strong> - Yes, it's a huge water park. But there are a ton of other activities at the Kalahari Resort and nearby. Plus, Friday afternoon we have Sara Chipps hosting a Jewelbots build event for kids 8 and up. They can learn to code too.</li>
    </ol>
    
    Join us as we discover the latest technologies to build amazing things. Along with all the fun and learning you'll do, we'll have some cool swag at our booth that you can grab.<br/><br/>

    See you in the Poconos!
