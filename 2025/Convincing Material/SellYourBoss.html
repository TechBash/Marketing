{Recipient Name},<br><br>

I wanted to send a quick request for your approval to attend the TechBash Developer Conference on November 4-7, 2025 in Mount Pocono,
Pennsylvania. This event will help us tremendously by demonstrating the latest trends in technology today as well as the hottest
technologies including, but not limited to, popular JavaScript frameworks, DevOps Technologies, Cloud implementations,
and AI. The event will improve our knowledge in these areas leading to greater productivity and efficiency.<br><br>

The event promises three days of in-depth and intensive technical training on some of the technologies we use every day. We will also
learn about other technologies that could further assist our efforts over the next twelve months. Right now, the conference tickets are
starting at just $799. If I stay overnight, the entire event would cost less than $1500. Similar events are typically priced starting at 
$2000 just for the conference ticket.<br><br>

<strong>As an attendee, I'll get to:</strong><br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Attend three days of training on technologies that we use.</li>
    <li>Learn the latest trends in application architecture.</li>
    <li>Hear how teams have implemented DevOps and pick up tips for improving our process.</li>
    <li>Discuss how to leverage Cloud technologies securely and learn about serverless.</li>
    <li>Discover how to update to the latest frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js, and .NET.</li>
    <li>See how AI and machine learning are shaping business decisions and disrupting the industry.</li>
</ul>

<strong>In addition, I can attend one of the following workshops on Tuesday before the main conference:</strong><br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Off the Shelf AI</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection (DI) in Csharp</li>
    <li>Workshop Duo: GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipelines</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL Introduction for the SQL Server Developer or DBA</li>
    <li>Contain Your Enthusiam - A Full Day with Containers and Kubernetes</li>
</ul>

I strongly believe that the information I can learn at this conference will allow me to help save our company time and money in the long
run. It will provide me a platform to learn new and improved ways to help lead our team, straight from the experts. I'll also have that
opportunity learning these items in just three days as opposed to other conferences that may require travel and keep me out of the office
for a few extra days. Therefore, I would like to request your approval to attend this conference. I would be more than happy to answer any
questions you may have or discuss this further. Thank you so much for you time and consideration.<br><br>

PS - If we send at least 5 people to the event, we can save money off per ticket. We can email one of the organizers at

Thanks!
